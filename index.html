        <p><code>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</code> is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
<p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>HTML is Free</li>
          <li>HMTL is Easy to Learn and Use</li>

    <p><code>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</code> is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

    <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.</p>

    <p>From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification.</p>

    <p><code>JavaScript (JS)</code> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>

    <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>

    <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features.</p>

    <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.</p>

    <p><code>Bootstrap</code> is a free, open source HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for quickly building responsive websites.</p>

    <p>Initially, Bootstrap was called Twitter Blueprint and was developed by a team working at Twitter. It supports responsive design and features predefined design templates that you can use out of the box, or customize for your needs with your code. You don't need to worry about compatibility with other browsers either, as Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers and newer versions of Internet Explorer.</p>
    
    <ul>
          <li>Fewer Cross browser bugs</li>
          <li>Lightweight and customizable</li>
          <li>Responsive structures and styles</li>
          <li>Several JavaScript plugins using the jQuery</li>
          <li>Good documentation and community support</li>
        </ul>

  <section id="REACT" class="main-section">

    <header>REACT</header>

    <p>As its official tagline states, <code>React</code> is a library for building user interfaces. React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments. For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications; React 360 can be used to build virtual reality applications; and there are other possibilities besides.</p>

    <p>To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we’re working with that colloquial understanding.</p>

    <p>React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.</p>

          <li>Strong community support</li>
          <li>Virtual DOM</li>
          <li>SEO-friendly</li>
          <li>More stable</li>
